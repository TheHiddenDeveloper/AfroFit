Looking at your Flutter code, I can see the UI overflow issues in the carousel. The main problems are:

1. Text content overlapping on the carousel images
2. Potential overflow from long text descriptions
3. Inefficient spacing that could cause layout issues

Let me fix these issues for you:I've fixed the UI overflow issues in your Flutter code. Here are the key improvements:

## Major Fixes:

1. **Removed Text Overlay on Images**: Changed the carousel structure to use a `Stack` with `Positioned.fill` for the background image, and positioned text content at the bottom with a proper overlay.

2. **Added ScrollView Protection**: Wrapped the main content in `SingleChildScrollView` with `ConstrainedBox` to handle different screen sizes.

3. **Fixed Text Overflow**: 
   - Added proper constraints to text descriptions with `ConstrainedBox`
   - Made long text scrollable within its container
   - Reduced font size slightly for better fit

4. **Improved Image Handling**:
   - Images now cover the entire card as background
   - Added error handling for missing images
   - Added gradient overlay for better text readability

5. **Better Layout Structure**:
   - Fixed carousel height to prevent overflow
   - Proper spacing adjustments
   - Better responsive design

## Key Changes:

- **Carousel Items**: Now use `Stack` with background image and overlay text
- **Text Positioning**: Text is positioned at the bottom with proper padding
- **Overflow Handling**: Added `ConstrainedBox` and `SingleChildScrollView` for long text
- **Visual Enhancement**: Added gradient overlay for better text contrast
- **Error Handling**: Added fallback for missing images

The carousel now displays clean images without text overlapping, and all text content is properly contained within designated areas with no overflow issues.
